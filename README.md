# GameDatabase
The purpose of this database will be to hold entries for my various games.
These entries will be items detailing different aspects of the game, and allow me to update them when needed.

Examples: Quests, Achievements, NPCs, Weapons, Environments, Unlockables, etc.

The purpose of this application is to help me learn Ruby on Rails for the backend API and PostgreSQL for the database.
The application will be hosted online, when finished, and will house different type of data, text, images, videos, sound, etc.
The front end will be developed in [TBD] to allow me to search through the various games and their entries.
